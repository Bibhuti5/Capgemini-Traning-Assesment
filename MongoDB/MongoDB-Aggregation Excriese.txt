Atlanta Population

1.Use db.zipcodes.find() to filter results to only the results where city is ATLANTA & state is GA

db.zipcodes.findOne({city: 'ATLANTA'},{state:'GA'})

2.Use db.zipcodes.aggregate with $match to do the same as above.
db.zipcodes.aggregate(
    [ { $match : {city: 'ATLANTA'}} ]
)
3.Use $group to count the number of zip codes in Atlant
db.zipcodes.aggregate(
    {$match:{city:'ATLANTA'}},
    {$group:{_id:'$loc'}},
    {$count:'loc'}
)

or 

db.zipcodes.find({city: 'ATLANTA'}).count()

4.Use $group to find the total population in Atlanta.
db.zipcodes.aggregate(
    {$match:{city:'ATLANTA'}},
    {$group:{_id:'$pop'}},
    {$count:'pop'}
)

Populations By state
1.Use aggregate to calculate the total population for each state

db.zipcodes.aggregate(
    //Nor currect   
    {$group:{_id:'$pop'}},
     {$each:{state:'$state'}},
    {$count:'pop'}
)


2.Sort the results by population , highest first
db.zipcodes.aggregate(
    // Sorting population highest first
    {$sort:{state:1,pop:-1}}
)

3.Limit the results to just the first 3 results. What are the top 3 states in population.

db.zipcodes.aggregate(
    // Sorting population highest first 3 states
    {$sort:{state:1,pop:-1}},
    // Limit the for first 3 state
    {$limit:3}
)

Population by City :
1.Use aggregate to calculate the total population for each city.
  Your can use a combination for the _id of the group.

db.zipcodes.aggregate(
    {$group:{_id:{pop:'$pop',city:'$city',state:'$state'}}},
    {$count:'pop'}
)

2.Sort the reuslts by population, Highest first
db.zipcodes.aggregate(
    // Sorting population highest first 3 states
    {$sort:{pop:-1}},
    {$limit:3}
)

3.Limit the results to just the first 3 results. What are the top 3 states in population.

db.zipcodes.aggregate(
    // Sorting population highest first 3 states
    {$sort:{city:1,pop:-1}},
    // Limit the for first 3 state
    {$limit:3}
)
4. What are the top 3 cities in population in Texas ?

db.zipcodes.aggregate(
    //State Texas
     {$match:{state:'TX'}},
    // Sorting population highest first 3 states
     {$sort:{city:-1,pop:-1}},   
    // Limit the for first 3 state
    {$limit:3}
)
