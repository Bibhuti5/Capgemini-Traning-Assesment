Because of everything Meredith has been through, she has become an amazing surgeon. Shonda Rhimes has put her character through so much, but her strength and persistance to keep going are what inspire us all. Just like she said in last night's episode, "Sometimes you play games in your head. You make up someone, someone good. Whatever you need to keep you going.”
